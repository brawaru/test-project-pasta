<h2>Processing fees</h2>
<p>To avoid paying unnecessary fee deductions, you may want to wait to transfer your money out after it accumulates for a bit rather than transferring as soon as you reach the minimum of {minimumAmount}.</p>
<h3>PayPal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>United States</strong>, PayPal charges a flat <strong>$0.25</strong> fee per transaction.</li>
  <li>In the rest of the world, PayPal charges a <strong>2%</strong> (up to $20) fee per transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modrinth will deduct <strong>2%</strong> for the fee (minimum of $0.25 and maximum of $20) from <strong>all transfers</strong> and if the fee PayPal charges is less than the amount we deducted, the difference will be added back to your Modrinth balance. This happens as Modrinth cannot determine if a transaction will be in the United States or international or not until after the transaction has been made.</p>
<h3>Venmo (United States only)</h3>
<p>Venmo will charge a $0.25 processing fee per transaction, which will be deducted from the amount you choose to transfer.</p>
<h2>Currency conversions</h2>
<p>All revenue generated by Modrinth is in United States dollars. Any conversions to your local currency will happen at withdrawal and is not handled by Modrinth. Modrinth cannot guarantee any exchange rate, so only USD is displayed in the creator dashboard.</p>
